## Creating Magento 2 Custom Module



* One interface file, to define our data contract for the Post

* A Post Model, to represent a Post throughout our code, implementing the Post data interface

* A Post Resource Model, to link the Post Model to the database

* A Post Collection, to retrieve several posts at once from the database with the help of the Resource Model

* Two migration classes, to set up our table schema and content

* Two Actions: one to list all posts and another to show each post individually

* Two each of Blocks, Views, and Layout files: One of each for the list action, and one of each for the view
